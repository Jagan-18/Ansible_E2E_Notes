# Ansible role
- It is a way to organize and structure your Ansible code into reusable and modular components. 
- It allows you to group related tasks, variables, templates, files, and handlers together in a standardized format, making it easier to manage, share, and reuse your automation across different projects and environments.

- Roles are a fundamental part of Ansible's best practices for organizing playbooks, as they provide a clear and consistent structure for automation.

### Key Components of a Role:
1. **Tasks**: The main tasks that the role will execute, usually defined in the `tasks/main.yml` file.
2. **Handlers**: Special tasks that are triggered by notifications (e.g., restart a service when a configuration file is changed). Handlers are usually defined in the `handlers/main.yml` file.
3. **Variables**: Variables specific to the role, defined in the `vars/main.yml` file or other variable files within the role.
4. **Defaults**: Default values for the variables, defined in the `defaults/main.yml` file.
5. **Templates**: Jinja2 template files (e.g., configuration files) used by the role, typically stored in the `templates/` directory.
6. **Files**: Static files that the role may need to copy to managed systems, found in the `files/` directory.
7. **Meta**: Metadata about the role, including role dependencies, defined in the `meta/main.yml` file.
8. **Library**: Custom modules or plugins for Ansible, if required, stored in the `library/` directory.
9. **Lookups**: Custom lookup plugins for querying external sources, defined in the `lookup/` directory.

### Example Role Directory Structure:
```
roles/
  └── myrole/
      ├── defaults/
      │   └── main.yml
      ├── files/
      │   └── myfile.conf
      ├── handlers/
      │   └── main.yml
      ├── meta/
      │   └── main.yml
      ├── tasks/
      │   └── main.yml
      ├── templates/
      │   └── mytemplate.j2
      └── vars/
          └── main.yml
```

### How to Use a Role in a Playbook:
Once you create a role, you can use it in a playbook by referencing the role name:

```yaml
---
- name: Configure web server
  hosts: webservers
  roles:
    - myrole
```

In this example, the playbook will execute the tasks and configuration defined in `myrole`.

### Benefits of Using Roles:
- **Reusability**: Roles can be reused across different playbooks and projects.
- **Modularity**: Each role can focus on a specific piece of functionality, such as installing a web server, configuring a database, or managing a service.
- **Maintainability**: By breaking your automation into roles, it becomes easier to maintain and update.
- **Sharing**: Roles can be shared with others, either within a team or in public repositories (like Ansible Galaxy).

Ansible roles help to organize your automation workflows in a scalable and structured way, making complex automation tasks easier to manage and execute.
